This directory (Models) has been copied and slightly modified from
[Ultimaker Cura](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura),
more specifically
[Cura/plugins/UM3NetworkPrinting/src/Models/](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/tree/master/plugins/UM3NetworkPrinting/src/Models)
provided under the LGPLv3.

This is helpful as these are the exact same models that the Http replies
are parsed into in Cura.

**Note**

This folder (`py2-Models`) is for compatibility with Python2 only.
It contains the same models but with typing removed,
as the Python3 typing syntax isn't available in Python2.
