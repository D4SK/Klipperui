Welcome to the Klippo project!

Klippo is a fork of the popular Klipper 3D printing software, adding a touchscreen UI and integration with Cura. Due to its modifications other webinterfaces are not compatible.
Installation requires a few extra steps, see the [Klippo Installation Guide](https://github.com/D4SK/klippo/blob/master/docs/Klippo_Installation.md).
