# kgui is the clean touch UI for your 3D Printer running Klipper.
It's compatible with common chinese 7 inch 1024*600 touch screens.
This plugin works best in conjunction with the [klipper_cura_connection](https://github.com/Gobbel2000/klipper_cura_connection) plugin.
A modyfied version of klipper is used, so other web-interfaces may have limited compatibility.
