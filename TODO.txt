Features to be implemented    
    Updater
    microcontroller flashing (maybe dead)
    gcode console
    custom gcode macro buttons

    better error handling (klipper)


Bugs
    timer to close error (on live move, homing)
    live_extrusion leaves inconsistent state
    extrusion when print paused, resuming crashes maybe related to above
    DripModeEndSignal during homing due to additional gcode move command or stop command
    uploading large gcode during printing with klipper_cura_connection -> timer too close
    cura showing old printjobs after klipper restart
