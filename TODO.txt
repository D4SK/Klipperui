Features to be implemented
    Updater
    custom gcode macro buttons
    finish Gcode console
    active cooldown after print
    
    avoid Print Bed Bolts
    red warning text on shutdown popup when there is a print ongoing or paused
    show large thumbnail behind text on homescreen. Add blur or frosted glass effect to hide low res and keep text readable, maybe with kivy effectWidget or python-pil
    auto start consecutive print when not interfering and correct material type, and enough material, otherwise print with offset, when option enabled
        maybe with following config options:
            printhead_x_min
            printhead_x_max
            printhead_y_min
            printhead_y_max
            gantry_orientation (x|y)
            gantry_xy_min
            gantry_xy_max
            gantry_z_min
    add TMC-261C support (+ pull request to klipper)
        the mcu should communicate to the drivers via spi, to set current and set control registers
        see extras/tmc.py, should hopefully be similar to other drivers in extras/tmc*.py (some of them also use spi)

            (we use spi-programmed mode, not standalone)
            (step-direction pins are used for sending position, not via spi)
Bugs
    live_extrusion leaves inconsistent state
    cura showing old printjobs after klipper restart
    must home axis first error after long paused print
