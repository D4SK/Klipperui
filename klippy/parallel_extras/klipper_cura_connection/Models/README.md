This directory (Models) has been copied and slightly modified from
[Ultimaker Cura](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura),
more specifically
[Cura/plugins/UM3NetworkPrinting/src/Models/](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/tree/master/plugins/UM3NetworkPrinting/src/Models)
provided under the LGPLv3.

This is helpful as these are the exact same models that the Http replies
are parsed into in Cura.
